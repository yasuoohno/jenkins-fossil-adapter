<div>
  <p>
The name or URL of the Fossil remote server. If the server has been registered on the machine
then it is only necessary to enter the name.
If no remote server is being used, leave this blank - do not use localhost.
Although Fossil permits it, do not include the username and password - use the appropriate fields for those values.
