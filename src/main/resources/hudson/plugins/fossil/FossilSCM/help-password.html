This is is the password for registered username for the fossil server. Note that local access is typically unauthenticated in Fossil. Check with your administrator.
Please note that this password is stored <i>in the clear</i>. In other words, it is not encrypted in the Jenkins database.

<em>Note:</em> Remember that Fossil does not permit empty passwords.
